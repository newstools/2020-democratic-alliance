The Democratic Alliance (DA) will write to the Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu, to request that her department look into disturbing reports alleging that ANC councillors across the country have hijacked the delivery of food parcels in order to electioneer. Vulnerable people should not have to worry whether their assistance depends upon the party they vote for, and the DA thus finds these allegations extremely concerning. It is disgraceful that some ANC councillors would use the delivery of food parcels during this lockdown to canvass voters. It is frankly immoral and low – even for the ANC. The Department must urgently look into these claims and ascertain how these councillors have been able to brazenly hijack food parcel deliveries for political gain. The Department of Social Development (DSD) is an independent organ of state, not an extension of Luthuli House. Furthermore, we will also raise the numerous complaints from the public that many poor and vulnerable communities have been overlooked by the department and have not received food parcels during this time. This lockdown inevitably causes uncertainty, and stress about food security should be avoided at all cost where possible. The DA will also raise concerns around the poor implementation of social distancing measures when distributing food parcels, with the Minister. We remind the Minister that social distancing is one of the few definite measures that protect people from Covid-19 infection. There can be no compromise in ensuring the safety of South Africans. It is the duty and privilege of the Department to care for those in their charge, and it is a responsibility which must be taken seriously. Minister Zulu cannot allow that her party takes advantage of vulnerable South Africans. The DA trusts that the Minister will deal with these matters with the urgency they require.
