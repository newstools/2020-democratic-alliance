The release of the Amended Lockdown Regulations on Thursday was a missed opportunity by Government to ease some of the draconian regulations which have been in place since the start of the Covid-19 lockdown and level with South Africans on the future of the economy. Government should have used the opportunity to announce the end to some of the illogical limitations on what can be sold in stores that are currently open and to announce the phasing in of critical sectors to get the economy going again. While the DA supports the lockdown and the need for regulations which will save lives, we must acknowledge that a number of regulations will not necessarily assist in combatting the pandemic; will not make life easier for citizens; nor will it improve our dire economic prospects. Government had an opportunity to revitalize the economy by re-introducing additional essential workers as many South Africans have not received a salary since the start of the lockdown. This places the country at risk of mass levels of hunger and social discontent. It was therefore important that Government took the initiative to relax some regulations and make the following announcements, as per the DA’s Smart Lockdown model: We urge President Ramaphosa and his Cabinet to assess these proposals as South Africa urgently needs regulations that not only keep the nation safe and healthy but will also assist essential workers, re-introduce critical workers to the economy, increase access to wages and reduce the risk of mass hunger.
