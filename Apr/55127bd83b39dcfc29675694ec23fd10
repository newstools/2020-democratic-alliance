The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation, Ms T Mahambehlala, to urgently convene a video conference meeting with the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) on the actions the South African government will take in relation to China’s alleged discriminatory treatment of African migrants. We have seen several media reports and video footage which allege that Chinese officials have accused the approximately 300 000 African nationals living in Guangzhou of being the cause of the second outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. It is being reported that black African nationals, in particular, are being targeted by the police and have also been forcefully evicted from their rented homes without notice. Some have been left with no option but to sleep on the streets as a result of this brutal treatment. The DA strongly condemns the Afrophobic discrimination and unfair treatment of African nationals by Chinese authorities. With President Cyril Ramaphosa as the Chairperson of the African Union, it is critical that South Africa assists in efforts to repair this situation. It is therefore vital that DIRCO briefs Parliament on its plan of action as well as the status of South Africa’s current relationship with China in light of the recall of the Chinese Ambassador from South Africa. The DA strongly believes that human rights and individual liberties should be protected irrespective of the outbreak of diseases. Law and order must be conducted in a manner that is fair, just, non-discriminatory and equal to all people residing in any country in the world. This also pertains to testing being undertaken in a manner that is also fair and non-violent in approach. The DA does not only have a responsibility to monitor human rights abuses of foreign nationals in South Africa – we are also morally obligated to monitor the treatments of vulnerable communities abroad.
