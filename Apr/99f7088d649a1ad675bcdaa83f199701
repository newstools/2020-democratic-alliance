The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on IPID to take the nation into their confidence by releasing daily updates on police abuses committed during the lockdown. The DA has received more than 500 complaints and queries on the Party’s dedicated WhatsApp line and email address to report police brutality since its launch at the beginning of the month. This week alone, we have seen disturbing reports of the police’s heavy-handedness: The DA has referred, advised and assisted with 190 complaints to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID); 40 complaints to the Military Ombud; and 7 complaints to other bodies or entities, such as the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). The majority of the complaints we have received have come from townships and informal settlements in urban areas where law enforcement officials have allegedly: The DA is disturbed and appalled by the nature of these complaints, and the fact that certain SAPS officials would mistreat vulnerable communities in this manner. While we must acknowledge the mammoth task and tremendous pressure SAPS officials are currently working under – we condemn the flagrant disrespect demonstrated by those few in uniform that disregard their mandate. The DA will write to the acting IPID head, Patrick Setshedi, to request that he release a daily report in the interests of transparency and accountability. It is apparent that despite the outcry and condemnation of police brutality from all sectors of society since the lockdown, a number of SAPS officials, including their Minister, continue to act as though they are above the law. The DA would like to remind the SAPS and other law enforcement officials that South Africa is a constitutional democracy, and while we find ourselves in an unprecedented period, the rule of law, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution must be adhered to at all times. We send our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the 8 year old boy who tragically lost his life
