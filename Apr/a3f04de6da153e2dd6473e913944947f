On Monday, Democratic Alliance (DA) Leader, John Steenhuisen, submitted the Party’s inputs on the draft regulations of the risk-adjusted level 4 Covid-19 lockdown to the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and Trade and Industry Minister, Ebrahim Patel. The DA welcomed Government’s decision to ease the hard lockdown from level 5 to level 4, in accordance to the DA’s Smart Lockdown. We are however concerned that there has been no real evidence produced by Government on which the risk-adjusted strategy has been based. This means that the decision to not open certain sectors of the economy have quite possibly not been based on research and fact, but rather on Government’s need to exert authority over South Africans. We are of the view that there is a need for the economy to be opened across a much wider spectrum as Government’s draft regulations does not go far enough to prevent an economic meltdown post-lockdown. The DA’s inputs on the draft regulations recognises the need for a lockdown to keep South Africans safe and healthy but also the socio-economic impact and the need to save livelihoods. We believe that with sectoral agreed health protocols for each level, there is no reason why we cannot see a broader opening of the economy opposed to what has been put on the table by Government. Here are some of the DA’s proposals on the draft risk-adjusted level 4 Covid-19 lockdown regulations: A full document on the DA’s inputs and comparison between National Government and the DA’s proposals can be accessed here.
