Please find attached soundbite by DA Shadow Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, Phumzile Van Damme MP. The admission of guilt fine paid by the Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams is to be welcomed as far as the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is concerned. However, a R1000 fine is not a sufficient penalty for a high-ranking politician like Ndabeni-Abrahams with a salary of approximately R2.5 million per annum. Political consequences are required in order to serve as a deterrent to other politicians who have or intend on breaking lockdown regulations. The NPA revealed this morning in a press statement that Ndabeni-Abrahams was charged with Contravention of Regulation 11(b) of the Disaster Management Act and was served with a summons to appear in the court on 22 May 2020, with an admission of guilt fine of R1000 set. The admission of guilt fine was per determination by the Magisterial District of Tshwane where the amount of R1000 has been set for the offence of failure to confine oneself to his/her place of residence. We are still of the opinion that President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s sanction of two months special leave with one month paid is insufficient and she should have been fired. The law applies to all equally and we trust that this will be the beginning of holding politicians to account for criminal acts even after lockdown has been lifted.
