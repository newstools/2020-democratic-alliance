The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the reopening of Parliament today. As the official opposition, we have long held the view that Parliament should continue to conduct its work to ensure oversight over the Executive, and that civil liberties are protected during the Covid-19 lockdown. The pandemic is not an excuse for Parliament to shirk its responsibilities and we are therefore pleased that Parliament has agreed to a number of the DA’s proposals on how the institution will conduct its business during the current Covid-19 lockdown. Parliament has agreed to look into the various ways in which committees will be able to meet virtually – particularly those committees that are responsible for oversight of departments intensively involved in the fight against Covid-19. The recent virtual health portfolio committee meeting has proven that, despite initial growing pains, virtual meetings can be conducive and effective in ensuring continued accountability during this extraordinary period. The DA has already requested several critical portfolio committee meetings to ensure that all government departments account to Parliament on measures put in place to combat Covid-19. We will continue to fight for these measures to be fair and transparent. The DA is also pleased that Parliament has agreed to our suggestion that a system is put in place to allow Parliamentary questions to be submitted electronically. Parliamentary questions are one of the critical means to conduct effective oversight of the Executive. We are excited that Parliament has come to the table to explore new and innovate ways to conduct its business. South Africa finds itself in an unprecedented time in its democratic history, and now more than ever, Parliament has to ensure that those who flagrantly and intentionally abuse their power and privilege, in the belief that they would never reap the consequences, are held to account.
