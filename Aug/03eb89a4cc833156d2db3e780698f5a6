The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) lawyers will today make arguments, before the Western Cape Division of the High Court, opposing the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s urgent application to interdict Parliament’s inquiry into her fitness to hold office. We believe that this legal action by Mkhwebane is frivolous and another attempt by her to frustrate a legitimate and legally sound Parliamentary process to hold her to account for her continuous mishaps at the helm of this crucial Chapter 9 institution. Mkhwebane wrongly claimed in court that the DA has a vendetta against her. This could not be further from the truth. Our decision to institute removal proceedings against her was based solely on her performance. In fact, the DA submitted over 7000 pages of supplementary evidence to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, to support our motion for the removal of Mkhwebane. Her tenure as Public Protector has been characterised by legal blunder after legal blunder, as well as questions around her independence. Some of her most notable mishaps include: Mkhwebane has demonstrated that she cannot conduct her work independently and has illustrated a poor understanding both of the law as well as of her mandate as Public Protector. She has proven that she is not fit for office and must be removed. Click here to contribute to the DA’s legal action challenging irrational and dangerous elements of the hard lockdown in court
