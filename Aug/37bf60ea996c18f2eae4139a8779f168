The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply saddened by the the passing of legendary South African radio personality, Bob Mabena. Mabena was not only a legend of our airwaves – he was also a pioneer and role model to many of South Africa’s current biggest and brightest broadcasters. For more than three decades, Mabena entertained our nation and was a constant feature of our daily lives through his music and radio shows. He was a giant in the media industry who has left an indelible mark in music, arts and broadcasting. The DA sends its heartfelt condolences to the Mabena family, friends and his PowerFM colleagues. May your soul Rest in Eternal Peace, Bob Mabena.
