The Democratic Alliance (DA) has seen an email dated, 12 August 2020, from a Public Protector official apologizing to the South African Roadies Association (SARA) for their delay in enforcing remedial action as it relates to the National Arts Council (NAC). In May, the Public Protector published a report that substantiated claims that NAC CEO, Rosemary Mangope, submitted a fake funding proposal on behalf of the SARA without their knowledge and consent, and recommended that remedial action be instituted. The remedial action included, among others instructions, an apology to the SARA from the CEO, that a standard operating procedure is implemented to address the inconsistencies in the NAC’s policies, that a “declaration of interests register” be initiated for all NAC employees, and that the CEO submit a report on how this remedial action would be implemented within 30 days following the release of the Public Protected report. The Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, previously informed the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture that the Mangope would take the report on review. It is now August, and the email that the DA has seen clearly suggests that Mangope has not taken the Public Protector’s report on review as she previously indicated she would, meaning that the remedial action is legally binding and the Minister and the CEO can no longer drag their feet. The DA is of the view that the Minister should in fact go a step further and fire the CEO for her grossly improper conduct. Government has recently made strong statements regarding the punishment of those found guilty of corruption and wrongdoing. Now is the perfect time for the Minister to demonstrate to all South Africans that criminality will no longer be tolerated in any sphere of Government.
