The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision taken today by Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Transport not to proceed with the Road Accident Benefit Scheme (RABS) Bill. The Bill, which lapsed in the 5th Parliament, sought to replace the current Road Accident Fund (RAF) Act. The DA did not support the resurrection of this Bill and made submissions today for Parliament to not proceed with the RABS Bill. Or submissions were overwhelmingly supported by the Committee. We thank our colleagues across the political divide who supported the DA in opposing and preventing the continuation of this disastrous bill. The DA is of the view that the RABS Bill is anti-poor, unaffordable and poses major stumbling blocks for road accident victims. Many South Africans agreed with the DA’s sentiments as evidenced by the bill failing to garner adequate public participation support. The Bill makes the following problematic proposals: In addition to this, current RAF claimants will have to be financed parallel to the RABS Bill which will have implications on the fuel levy. Neither the fiscus nor South African consumers would have been able to afford two road crash compensation streams. While the RAF system is rife with problems, the RABS Bill is simply not an acceptable alternative. The DA firmly believes that addressing the current shortcomings in the RAF system can be done by the introduction of amendments to the current RAF legislation, and not through the disastrous RABS Bill.
