The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) has today revealed in Parliament that certain Executives of both the Services and the Wholesale and Retail (W&R) Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETA) do not have the necessary and required qualifications to occupy their respective positions. This revelation lays bare the root of the problems at SETAs which have led to dubious transactions, maladministration and governance instability. They fall short of being institutions that the South African people can be proud of. As recipients of billions in taxpayer money annually, SETAs have an important role to play in the training and education of millions of South Africans. It is almost ironic then that the very people responsible for the upskilling and educations of South Africans, could not even be bothered to employ people with the required skills and qualifications to lead these SETAs. The DA will, therefore, write to the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Dr Blade Nzimande, to request the following: There is absolutely no justification for people to be pushed into an Executive position without having the right qualifications. If anything, this explains the number of qualified audits at Service and W&R SETAs as a result of irregular expenditure. For a long time, the focus has been who gets what position at SETAs, rather than fulfilling the mandate of developing skills of the millions of South African youth who are not yet in education, employment or training. The numerous challenges face by SETAs are not insurmountable, but the first most crucial step is ensuring that the right people with the requisite qualification are hired for top positions, instead of politically aligned cadres who are hell-bent on continuing corruption.
