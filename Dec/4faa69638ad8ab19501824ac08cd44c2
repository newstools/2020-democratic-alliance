The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the announcement by the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, that the Mathematics and Physical Science Matric Examination papers will be rewritten following leaks last month. It is unfortunate that all Matriculants will now have to suffer the consequences of the poor decisions made by a few. The lessons learned from the initial leaks should not be repeated again in the rewrite and we trust that these leaks will serve as a wake up call for the Department of Basic Education to strengthen security as it relates to Matric Exams in future.  The DA calls on law enforcement agencies to ensure that the investigations into these leaks are completed promptly to ensure that all those implicated and found guilty are held to account.
