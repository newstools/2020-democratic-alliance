The Democratic Alliance (DA) extends its heartfelt condolences to the family of well-known Kruger Park game ranger, Mr Checkers Mashego after remains were discovered believed to be his. Mr Mashego was a respected ranger with over 10 years’ experience. The DA welcomes the ongoing investigation into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Mr Mashego who went missing during a routine patrol. The welfare of rangers and their families remains of paramount importance and I will be writing to the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbary Creecy, to ascertain what measures are currently in place to ensure the safety and well-being of rangers in the Kruger National Park. Our brave rangers do so much to protect and preserve our environment and our precious wildlife and it is important that we remember and honour the work of Mr Mashego and other rangers across the country.
