The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the postponement of the motion of no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa, pending the outcome of a review process which will be heard in February. The DA holds the view that this motion by the African Transformation Movement (ATM) is nothing more than a frivolous internal ANC factional battle playing itself out on the floor of Parliament. The matter of the secret ballot is now between the ATM and the Zuma/Magashule faction; the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Western Cape Division of the High Court. While we respect any party’s right to move a motion of no confidence, we fought hard for those processes to be flexible, accessible and practical. The ATM’s motion, however, is a waste of Parliament’s programme which needs to urgently consider and deliberate on the various budgets of Departments and entities tabled before it. The DA will abstain from this vote even when it comes to Parliament next year. Abstaining is by no means a vote in support of President Ramaphosa. It is instead our refusal to be drawn into a messy battle brewing in the ANC. We will continue to hold the President and his government to account using parliamentary and legal processes. The DA has placed the President on terms and urge him to urgently table his Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan before Parliament for it to be passed and implemented without delay. If he fails to show backbone against those who seek to plunge South Africa’s economy deeper into the abyss, we will certainly, in future, reconsider our decision to abstain from such a motion.
