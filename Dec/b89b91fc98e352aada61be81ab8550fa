The Democratic Alliance is deeply saddened at the passing of DA member of Parliament, Shadow Minister of Higher Eduction, Constituency Head, acclaimed academic, friend and colleague, The Honourable Professor Belinda Bozzoli MP. Belinda was deeply committed to her work in Parliament, she was deeply committed to making sure that higher education institutions remained respected and that as many young people as possible had access to excellent higher education. Her work was that of a true patriot. A fighter of principle and and true Democrat. Belinda worked long into her illness, demonstrating her absolute commitment to South Africa and her caucus. Our deepest sympathies go to her husband, two sons, daughter and all her family and friends. South Africa is the poorer for not having Belinda fighting for their rights. May she Rest In Peace
