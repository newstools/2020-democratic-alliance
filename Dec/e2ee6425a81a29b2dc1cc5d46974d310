While the Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the arrest of a suspect in connection to the leaked Matric Physics and Mathematics examination papers, there are still questions that we urgently need clarity on to ensure the credibility of what is left of the exams and to ensure that it does not happen again. The following points need clarifying: The DA is also concerned about the potential consequences of the leak. Will the learners implicated need to re-write the exam? It was reported that the mathematics paper was shared on a WhatsApp group. This means that some learners could be implicated in the leak even though they might not have intended to participate in the offence. There are also reports that the Mathematics Paper 1 were leaked. Is the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, and her Department investigating these reports? And have there been even more leaks that the Department is trying to keep quiet? The Minister cannot wait any longer to address these questions, as well as give clarity regarding any potential re-writes that would be needed as parents and learners need to prepare. The credibility of this year’s matric examination is already being questioned, and the Minister must act now to ensure that the hard work and diligence of the 2020 Matrics, who already faced extremely difficult odds, would not be for naught.
