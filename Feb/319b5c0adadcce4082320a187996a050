The Democratic Alliance (DA) has taken note of reports indicating that former President Jacob Zuma will attend the 2020 State of the Nation Address. Mr Zuma was too sick to attend his trial at the Pietermaritzburg Division of the KwaZulu-Natal High Court and too sick to attend the Zondo Commission yet now he is seemingly fit as a fiddle to travel all the way to Cape Town to attend the pomp and pageantry that is SONA. To add insult to injury, Mr Zuma’s “doctor” reportedly booked him off until April. It would seem that the only illness that Mr Zuma is suffering from is an inability to appear before court and facing justice for the corruption charges that he faces. Quite frankly, if Mr Zuma is not too ill to attend SONA in Cape Town, then he certainly is not too ill to attend his court hearing in Pietermaritzburg. Furthermore, having Mr Zuma at SONA, in a place known to us all, would certainly make it much easier for the clerk of the court to issue his warrant of arrest.
