The Democratic Alliance (DA) has asked the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education, Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba, to haul Limpopo Education MEC, Polly Boshielo and other senior Department officials before the Committee to account for snubbing a crucial schools oversight inspection in the province. Today, in response to the DA’s criticism last week to her, her Head of Department and Chief Financial Officer abandoning the oversight at the last minute to attend an ANC lekgotla, the MEC said: “I am an MEC of education deployed by the ANC. It is clear that when the ANC calls me, I must respond to that call”. The MEC and her officials should not be let off the hook. Limpopo recorded the worst matric pass rate in the country, coupled with the most amount of 0% schools. On Tuesday the DA reported on the Thabakhibidu school in Thabazimbi where 57 learners share one classroom. This province’s schools are in a state of emergency and there should simply be no other matters more important for the MEC to concern herself with. Her decision to choose an ANC lekgotla over attending Parliament’s oversight inspection is akin to dereliction of duty – and her comments today are indicative of her disregard of the Constitution and the rules and values which govern her duties and responsibilities as an MEC. The DA strongly rejects public office bearers placing their personal political ambitions above the interests of the people who elected them to serve.
