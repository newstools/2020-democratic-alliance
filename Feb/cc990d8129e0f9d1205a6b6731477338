The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Minister Trade & Industry and Economic Development, Ebrahim Patel, today requesting that he comes and briefs the portfolio committee on trade, industry and economic development on the dire situation at Arcelor Mittal South Africa (AMSA). In the letter we raise concerns regarding the events unfolding at AMSA following their announcement on the 6th of February 2020 that they would be shedding a further 400 jobs at their Newcastle and Vereeniging plants. This is in addition to the 1000 jobs lost at AMSA’s Saldanha Bay plant, which was closed down as result of a restructuring plan. Considering the country’s unemployment rate which presently sits at 29% and the raft of retrenchments happening in the private sector, the public and the portfolio committee deserves to know what’s going on. The DA has consistently called for reform in the steel industry and will continue to fight for those most vulnerable to losing their jobs. We cannot allow the jobs bloodbath to continue.
