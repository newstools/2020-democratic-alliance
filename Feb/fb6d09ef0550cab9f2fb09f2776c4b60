The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes reports indicating that former Head of Intelligence, Mo Shaik, has resigned as a Special Advisor to Lindiwe Sisulu, Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation (DHSWS). Shaik’s resignation is a direct result of DA pressure, following our revelation that Shaik had been appointed by Minister Sisulu, despite not having qualifications relating to his role as a special advisor on water services. The DA claims Shaik’s decision to resign as a victory for all South Africans. There is no place for ANC cadres and their politically-connected consultancies being employed in government departments, already buckling under the weight of corruption and maladministration. We now await Menzi Simelane’s resignation as Sisulu’s second Special Advisor, and will continue to interrogate all appointments and consultancy awards made by the Ministry.
