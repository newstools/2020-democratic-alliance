The Democratic Alliance (DA) supports the High Court application brought by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, requesting an extension of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The DA believes more work is yet to be done to uncover the true extent of the looting and corruption which occurred during the state capture years, and Judge Zondo’s Commission of Inquiry has played an important role in uncovering much of this truth. If Deputy Chief Justice Zondo is of the mind that there is more to be exposed, then he must be afforded the time to do so. It is critically important that this extension is granted in order to ensure a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the testimonies and evidence which have been produced by witnesses and in some cases willing participants in the capture of our state. We are acutely aware that an extension has monetary implications for the people of South Africa, but this dwarfs in comparison to the billions lost and the billions that will be recovered once the Commission has thoroughly completed its work. The Zondo Commission was established in order to provide South Africans with answers. The Commission’s findings could potentially result in the launch of dozens of prosecutions, and if more time is needed to unearth the rot, it can only mean that there are more individuals who need to be interrogated and testimonies to be heard.
