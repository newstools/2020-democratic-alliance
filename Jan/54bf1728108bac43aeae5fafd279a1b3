The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the extension of the Section 25 Amendment Bill public participation period to 29 February 2020. We have long held the view that the public participation period would have been severely curtailed by gazetting of the Bill in December 2019, coupled with the festive season and the 31 January  2020 deadline. The DA unequivocally opposes the amendment of Section 25, the Property Clause, of the Constitution and we reject land expropriation without compensation. Section 25 is not an impediment to meaningful land reform, but rather the corruption, mismanagement, and lack of political on the part of the ANC government. The DA-run Western Cape has a 72% success rate in agricultural land reform projects compared to an estimated 10% success rate nationally. Further proof that meaningful land reform is possible through a capable and competent government. The DA’s online objection portal has already received thousands of objections from ordinary South Africans who reject the proposed amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution. We urge South Africans to protect the Constitution and use this extension to come out in their numbers and voice their objections to this disastrous Bill.
