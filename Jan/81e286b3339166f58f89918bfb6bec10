The DA has written a letter to the Ambassador of Oman in South Africa to share its condolences with the people of Oman on the passing of their ruler Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Sultan Qaboos will best be known for his long reign of half a century in which he was progressive in foreign relationships and responsible for brokering many talks between Countries in the Middle East and Western countries. Many world leaders gave him the title of the stable force of the Middle East. At a time where US and Iran tension is boiling, we hope that Sultan Qaboosâ€™ successor will continue to strive for stability and peace in the Middle East.
