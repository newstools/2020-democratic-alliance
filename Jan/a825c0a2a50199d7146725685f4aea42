Following a partial and distorted leak of the DA’s internal investigation into the Party’s mishandling of the Schweizer-Reneke incident last year, there has been a further attempt to manipulate the matter for political purposes. A partial truth is often more dangerous than a deliberate lie, and this is definitely the case in relation to the Schweizer-Reneke investigation. The DA will not deviate from its course of giving a report-back first – and directly – to the interested and affected parties in Schweizer-Reneke. Media speculation and political agitation will not force us to deviate from our agreed course of action. We are determined to act with integrity in this matter and to discuss the full context of the events and their aftermath directly with the interested and affected parties. This issue and the individuals involved, have been used as political footballs for long enough and it is time to bring this to an end.
