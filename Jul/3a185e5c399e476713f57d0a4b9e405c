This morning, the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Chief Whip in the National Assembly, Natasha Mazzone MP, received a memorandum from the Private Charter Passenger Association (PCPA) at the gates of Parliament. This follows a slow-drive protest by the association, from Athlone to Parliament. Throughout the lockdown tour guides and private charters across the country have been unable to earn an income. To date, the R30 million Tour Guides’ Relief Fund promised by government has not materialized. The DA supports this sub-section of the Tourism industry and we are happy to receive their memorandum and hand it to the Tourism and Transport Ministers, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane and Fikile Mbalula.
