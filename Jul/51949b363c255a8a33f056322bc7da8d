The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape applauds the progress the DA-run City of Cape Town has made to grow our local economy and develop our communities. In Atlantis this week, the City has made huge strides in the establishment of the Atlantis Special Economic Zone. Following the Mayoral Committee’s agreement to recommend to Council to approve the transfer of land in Atlantis, the Atlantis Special Economic Zone is one step closer to realisation. This initiative will see the establishment of a GreenTech hub which focusses on the ‘green’ market currently growing globally. It aims primarily to secure a better future, not only for the Western Cape Province as a whole but also for Atlantis and its residents. It is expected that by 2034, this initiative will have contributed over R15 billion to the Western Cape GDP and the creation of many new job opportunities. Initiatives, such as the Atlantis Special Economic Zone project, emphasises the DA’s commitment to growing the economy, create employment opportunities and build a South Africa that prospers. We commend the City for being the caring City the people deserve by alleviating poverty through the creation of job opportunities and skills development. We look forward to seeing this development progress and we support the City’s efforts to ensure that not only the residents of Atlantis but also the Western Cape as a whole be well taken care of and be given the opportunities they deserve.
