The DA condemns the attack on Mr Betrus Kotze on his farm at Tinmyne in the Mokgalakwena municipality yesterday late afternoon. Mr Kotze was ambushed at his cattle kraal, tied up and viciously attacked. He suffered serious injuries. The farm workers at the kraal were already tied up. The attackers were on the way to the farm house, but the farm workers there suspected that something was wrong and called Mr Kotze’s nephew for assistance. The attackers fled to a nearby settlement where they were picked up by a vehicle at the tarred road. This is the second attack on Mr Kotze in 2 months. The attackers were identified as the same in both attacks. It is clear that the SAPS in the remote areas of Mokgalakwena municipality are not adequately resourced to effectively deal with farm attacks, hence the re-occurrence. During the July 2020 there were also farm attacks at Percy Fyfe and Dwaalboom in Mokgalakwena municipality. In June 2020 the DA undertook to action some measures in the fight against these heinous crimes. This includes: We call on all those living in rural areas to be vigilant and to take extra safety precautions during the extended lockdown. It is time for the provincial government to pay serious attention to farm attacks  in our province. Farmers and farm workers alike need to feel safe in their homes. We wish Mr Kotze, his workers and those who were traumatised by both attacks a speedy recovery.
