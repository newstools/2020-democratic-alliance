The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes with concern the alleged attack on leadership of the Onderstepoort Biological Property (OBP) and will submit parliamentary questions to the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza. The OBP CEO, Dr Baptiste Dungu, and members of the Board have reportedly received calls in recent times from unknown people making “malicious and mischievous statements” about the management of the State-owned enterprise (SOE). This is deeply concerning as OBP is one of the few SOEs that continue to operate profitably and has its own cash reserves. The company has also seen an increase in turnover since the takeover of Dr Dungu as the CEO in 2019. These attacks on the OBP is therefore alarming as it is common knowledge that SOEs are usually looted once they come under attack. OBP has had its fair share of controversy over the years: The DA commend the work that OBP has been doing on its journey to recover from the past misery of losing market share by ensuring that products are available and addressing challenges of the new products and their adaptation. The DA will be asking the following questions to Minister Didiza: With so many SOEs failing due to mismanagement and looting, South Africa cannot afford to let another one fall foul of what seems to be attempts to destabilise this SOE.
