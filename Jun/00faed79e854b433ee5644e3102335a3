The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Small Business Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni and Tourism Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane demanding that the regulations for restaurants and cinemas to operate under “advanced level 3” are published by the close of business on Friday, 26 June 2020. It has now been eight days since President Ramaphosa announced that these sectors, as well as the personal care industry would be allowed to open, subject to health protocols. To date, the only protocols that have been published were that of the personal care industry so that government could save themselves from a humiliating court case which they would have lost. It is simply inexplicable why the regulations for restaurants and cinemas have not been issued, leaving thousands of businesses in South Africa uncertain as to when they can open and what regulations they will need to comply with in order to do so. What have these Ministers been doing for the last eight days exactly? This cack-handed approach by government to these regulations is not acceptable and they should be released immediately to avoid any further legal action in forcing ministers to do the jobs they are paid to do.
