The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written a follow-up letter to the Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni, to request that the newly-appointed Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) board members launch an investigation into the appointment of Ms Jenitha John as its CEO. The DA wrote to Minister Mboweni on 21 May 2020 to request details of the proposed appointment of Ms John as the CEO of the IRBA. Despite the passage of some five weeks since writing the letter and receiving an acknowledgement from the Minister, there has been no substantive reply to the issues raised by the DA. The concerns around the appointment of Ms John, amongst other possible concerns, are mainly surrounding: On 29 May 2020, Minister Mboweni publicly made a commitment to discuss, with the board, the concerns around Ms John’s controversial appointment. It is for this reason, and in the interest of accountability, that I have written a follow-up letter to the Minister to request: There are significant questions about the process followed for the appointment of Ms John as the CEO of the IRBA and we simply will not accept silence from the Minister in this regard.
