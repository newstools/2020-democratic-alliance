The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Oudtshoorn can confirm that the Executive Mayor of Oudtshoorn, Mr Colan Sylvester, resigned yesterday amidst his disciplinary hearing. He will vacate his office at the end of June 2020. The matter of Mr Sylvester has been looming for over a year. There were several charges against him and it is clear that Mr Sylvester’s resignation follows his conviction and he took off before the Party could act on his misconduct. These charges included the following: The DA has been trying to conclude this matter with Mr Sylvester for several months, who, on various occasions, tried to postpone the matter. Oudtshoorn has been suffering under this uncertainty and instability for the past two years and as the DA in Oudtshoorn, we welcome the opportunity to rebuild what was broken. We look forward to renewal and change, and the opportunity to return to an environment of accountability and effective leadership.
