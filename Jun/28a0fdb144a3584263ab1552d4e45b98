The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes with concern that the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture seems to once again have released regulations without consulting those in the arts industry. It is time the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, truly engaged with the industry in ways that will assist, instead of hamper, the reopening the sector and help artist desperate to return to their craft and earn an income, by exploring support funding for artists and theaters for online performances. The Minister should meet with the industry to find solutions for Government to assist the community to safely and securely perform their productions online. We will remind the Minister that most South African artists were excluded from his Departmentâ€™s Covid-19 relief funding due largely to its ill-conceived application process and his refusal to reopen the application process. The DA has extensively engaged with the arts community and there are several concerns around the recently gazetted regulations: A new revenue stream that has recently become more viable due to the lockdown, is to stream performances on online platforms. Many artists have had to make this jump to virtual performances, some with great success. But theatres and producers have expressed concern that they will not be able to cover the full production cost of streaming performances online with concerns about secure and encrypted platforms as well as internet costs. Unless the Minister takes the time to truly engage with artists and understand their concerns and realities, he can never offer anything other than poorly drafted regulations that only serve to confuse and prolong suffering.
