The Democratic Alliance (DA) will submit an application in terms of the Public Access to Information Act (PAIA) for the release of 3 critical documents relating to alleged corruption at the National Lotteries Commission (NLC), namely: The DA has decided to take this course of action because the NLC and the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Ebrahim Patel have denied multiple requests for this information to be made public. This is unthinkable considering the alleged pervasive corruption at the entity. Their efforts in undermining democratic accountability and transparency have been supplemented by ANC members of the portfolio committee on Trade, Industry and Competition who at every turn have tried to prevent the release of this information. Their latest attempt in this regard has been to hide behind a request for a legal opinion from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor in order to stall the appearance of the NLC before the portfolio committee and the release of NLC beneficiaries. The truth is there is no need for a legal opinion as prior to the 2018-2019 financial year all beneficiaries of NLC proactive-funding were made public and Section 67 of the National Lotteries Act does not prevent them from making this information public. The DA will continue to fight for the transparent and prudent use of public money – the NLC is no exception. We will continue to act as a bulwark against any form of state capture.
