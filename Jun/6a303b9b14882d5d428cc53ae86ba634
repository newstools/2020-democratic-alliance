The Democratic Alliance (DA) reiterates its call on the Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni, to support our proposal for the creation of a Special Inspector-General in the National Treasury to prevent and probe corruption related to Covid-19 relief, recovery and stimulus funding. The DA’s proposal on the Special Inspector-General can be seen here. We have already witnessed dubious expenditure and questions around relief aid since the start of the lockdown period: Covid-19 relief funds have been put in place because of the need for relief, supplies and services to be redirected towards the country’s efforts to defeat the virus. However, some have seemingly used this opportunity for self-enrichment at the expense of the state and the vulnerable. It is for this reason that the DA believes it has become critically important for an Office of the Inspector General to be created within Treasury so that we can ensure that every single cent meant for relief is directed towards its intended purpose and not corrupt politicians and their friends. In light of the vile acts by those who are exploiting the Covid-19 crisis, the DA once urges Shamila Batohi, the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), to give an update and clarity on the progress of the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) special Covid-19 anti-corruption units. We cannot allow for time to pass by without any action being taken against those who have been implicated in wrongdoing. We are tired of tough talk, it’s time for action.
