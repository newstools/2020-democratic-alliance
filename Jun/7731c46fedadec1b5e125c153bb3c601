The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire the Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu. The Minister has reportedly stated recently that she never expected the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic would have such a crippling impact on the poor. This has not been the first time the Minister has put her foot in her mouth during the pandemic. During the early stages of the lockdown, Minister Zulu posted on Instagram that she had a hard time staying at home and that the “[Coronavirus] must go away”. Minister Zulu has proven that she is completely out of touch with the realities that poor and vulnerable South Africans face and that she is clearly incapable of running the Department of Social Development (DSD). The DSD and the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) have performed dismally during this time of crisis. Their mandate is to provide social relief during a disaster and to manage and distribute relief. However, the DSD and SASSA’s response has been wholly inadequate and they have failed at every turn. The Minister, her department and SASSA have not only buckled under pressure since the start of the lockdown, they have proven that they are incapable of providing relief to the poor and vulnerable. Minister Zulu is not fit for purpose and she has shown nothing but disdain for the poor and vulnerable. Her apologies are hollow and do not mean anything for the millions of South Africans whose dignity she has disregarded. The DA calls on President Ramaphosa to do the right thing and remove Minister Zulu from office.
