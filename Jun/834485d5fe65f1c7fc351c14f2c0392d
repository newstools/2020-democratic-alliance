Only 662 names of child murderers and rapist have been submitted by the Department of Justice (DoJ), during the past 7 years, to the Department of Social Development (DSD) for inclusion onto Part B of the Child Protection Register (CPR) – used to record people who are unsuitable to work with children to protect them from abuse. This was revealed in a reply to a Democratic Alliance (DA) parliamentary question. Section 120 (4) of the Children’s Act sates, “in criminal proceedings, subject to the provisions of subsection (4A) a person must be deemed unsuitable to work with children; (a) on conviction of murder, attempted murder, rape, indecent assault or any other sexual offence contemplated in the Criminal Law Amendment Act.” It is painfully clear that the justice system is dismally failing our children. Last week, the DA wrote to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) regarding the fact that only 1 660 names appear on Part B of the CPR.  This was after a parliamentary reply by the Department of Social Development. The DA requested that the SAHRC reopen their investigation into the failing of our justice system in protecting our children. We are yet to receive an acknowledgment from them let alone an indication as to whether they will accede to the request. The number of names submitted each year by the DoJ to the DSD is as follows: The above figures are an embarrassment to the countries fight against child murder and abuse. The DA will once again write to SAHRC to make them aware of the failing of the DoJ and that their 2013 report into the Register has been ignored.
