The Democratic Alliance (DA) is in its final stages of completing its private member’s bill (PMB) which will be tabled before Parliament soon. If passed, this bill will replace the current Domestic Violence Act and the Protection from Harassment Act with legislation better suited to protect victims of inter-personal and domestic abuse. There’s been a new wave of essential discussions around abuse of and violence against women in South Africa. Women in this country are dying at an alarming rate at the hands of partners, family and friends. Campaign after campaign has been launched to try and stem the tide of horrible abuse and femicide that women in South Africa face every day with very little impact. Just this past two weeks, we have seen the horrible murders of Tshegofatso Pule, Naledi Phangindawo and Altecia Kortjie and her daughter, Raynecia. They are sadly not the only ones. The only true way to derail this runaway train is to empower victims of abuse with powerful legislation that strengthens the powers granted to courts and the South African Police Service (SAPS) to protect the rights of vulnerable people in the places they should have felt most safe – their homes. The DA’s PMB will focus on nine key proposals: The time to pay lip service to victims of domestic and inter-personal abuse is over. Urgent and meaningful action is needed to root out this evil in our society once and for all. Legislative amendments and the enforcement thereof will in itself not solve this problem and as a Party we are also working on social and economic policy proposals to address the scourge of gender-based violence in South Africa. The DA sends its condolences to the families and loved ones of Tshegofatso Pule, Naledi Phangindawo, Altecia and Raynecia Kortjie, and all the countless women and children who lost their lives.
