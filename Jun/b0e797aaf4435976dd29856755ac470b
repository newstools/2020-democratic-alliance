The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape is saddened by the passing of one of our dear colleagues, Thandi Mpambo-Sibhukwana MP. She was a dedicated Member of Parliament since 2014, who served at the NCOP and then moved to the National Assembly in 2019 to date. She served on the Portfolio Committee on Social Development. Thandiâ€™s hopes for our country had always been to alleviate poverty and unemployment, and she actively fought against the housing backlog that keeps our poor communities from receiving the shelter they deserve. She was also deeply passionate about the community of people with disabilities and always ensured that they are not left behind. Thandi served her constituencies with dedication as Constituency Head in Saldanha and Drakenstein from 2014 to 2019, and then Oostenberg South since 2019. We send our heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and colleagues, and we wish them all the strength during this difficult time.
