Please find attached soundbite by Dean Macpherson, DA Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry. Please also find the DA’s Founding Affidavit and the Notice of Motion. Tomorrow, Friday 12 June, at 10am, the Democratic Alliance (DA) will present it’s case to the Western Cape High Court to have the irrational and unconstitutional ban on personal care services overturned. This is an important case for the DA but also for the hundreds of thousands of South Africans that have had their livelihoods shattered by the inaction of government to set in place health regulations that will allow hairdressers, beauticians and tattoo artists to operate in a safe environment for them and their customers. The DA looks forward to this opportunity to hopefully get these hardworking men and women in the personal care industry back to work so that they too can keep a roof over their head and put food on their table.
