The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the Mpati Commission Report recommending that the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) instigate a full-scale review of all existing deals between the entity and Sekunjalo Investment Holdings in order to recoup any money that was invested in Sekunjalo companies. The DA also supports the recommendation that the report be forwarded to the NPA and all relevant authorities to take necessary steps. The report has exposed the false claims by Sekunjalo that they had been cleared by the Mphati Commission. Both Iqbal Survé and Dan Matjila must be held accountable for their alleged wrongdoing. The long-overdue release of the Mpati Commission Report today paints a scathing picture of the unholy alliance between Survé’s Sekunjalo Holdings and the former PIC CEO, Dan Matjila. The report makes the following damning findings: It is shocking that the entity in charge of the investments of the hard-earned livelihoods of servants, pensioners and beneficiaries became so utterly compromised to the point where a private company meddled in the institution’s investment decisions.
