Note to Editors: Please find attached a video and soundbite by DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Baxolile ‘Bax’ Nodada MP. The Leader of the  Democratic Alliance (DA) John Steenhuisen has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa to compel Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande to show leadership and take action to resolve the unrest on campuses across the country. Three days after the Minister painted a rosy picture that higher education institutions were ready for the 2020 academic year during his executive statement in Parliament – students at institutions across the country are still protesting and disrupting the start of the 2020 academic year. It is for this reason that the DA has urged the President to compel Minister Nzimande to intervene as students at many higher education institutions have been left destitute and unable to pay for food and accommodation. Currently: These continued disruptions and violence at tertiary institutions, not only trample on other students’ right to access to education, but it could potentially have a ripple effect, spread and destabilise campuses across the country. The buck stops with Minister Nzimande, and he needs to act now to prevent a complete meltdown at campuses. The DA, therefore, requested the following interventions from the Minister: It is unacceptable that Minister Nzimande continues to be aloof as campuses are burning and students across the country are without food and transport allowances. We urge the Minister to remember his primary responsibility, which is to ensure that every South African has fair access to higher education in a conducive and safe environment.
