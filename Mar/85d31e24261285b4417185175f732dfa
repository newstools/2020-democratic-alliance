Please find an attached soundbite by Tsepo Mhlongo MP, DA Shadow Minister of Sports, Arts & Culture The Democratic Alliance (DA) will write to the chairperson of the portfolio committee on sports, arts, and culture to request an urgent meeting with the leadership of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) to update Parliament on its readiness for the upcoming March 28 leadership elections where the federation will elect a new president and board. The leadership race has already been marred by controversy which includes the disqualification of Athletics SA head‚ Aleck Skhosana, Free State Rugby president, Jerry Segwaba, and Netball SA head, Cecilia Molokwane. Reports today indicate that both Skhosana and Segwaba are currently challenging this decision. The DA is calling for free, fair and independent SASCOC elections, and that the disputes will be handled efficiently and expediently in accordance with the prescripts of the National Sport and Recreation Act 18 of 2007 which offers clear guidance on how disputes of this nature are to be handled and ultimately resolved. SASCOC’s leadership over the past number of years can only be described as chaotic and dysfunctional – at best. For years, SASCOC has been hamstrung by internal squabbles and political meddling which have restricted its ability to deliver the country’s best athletes to international sports arenas. The DA, therefore, urge all those who will vote in these elections to adhere to SASCOC’s constitution, keeping the interests of South Africa’s sports development and athletes first when they cast their votes.
