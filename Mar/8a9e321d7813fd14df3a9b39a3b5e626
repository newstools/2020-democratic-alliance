The Democratic Alliance’s proposal to introduce a fiscal anchor to stabilise national debt reached a significant stage on Friday, when our notice of intention to table the Fiscal Responsibility Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment. The Bill will be tabled in Parliament this week. We now call on all South Africans to submit their comments on the Bill which, if passed, will limit any of government’s ability to borrow more. This will help reduce national debt and the associated debt service costs. The Fiscal Responsibility Bill provides for: Second, the Fiscal Responsibility Bill provides for: And, finally, because South Africa is a small open economy, vulnerable to shocks, the Fiscal Responsibility Bill provides for: Debt service costs is the fastest growing expenditure item on the national budget. We will already spend more than R220 billion on interest charges in 2020. If nothing is done to reverse this trend, national debt is set to increase to a staggering R4,2 trillion, or 67,5% of GDP by 2022/23. These unsustainable debt levels are crowding out budgets for basic service delivery, a reality which became apparent in the 2020 national budget, where budget cuts were made to housing, school infrastructure, health and public transport. The Fiscal Responsibility Bill is an opportunity for the ANC to work together with the DA to pass a Bill that will not only stabilise national finances but also create the confidence needed to assure investors that the government is committed to prudent fiscal management. We therefore call on the ANC to support the FRB. The DA looks forward to the participation by members of the public on the processing of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill. Stakes for South Africa’s economic health have never been higher and the Bill is an opportunity to put the country on a path of sustainable economic recovery.
