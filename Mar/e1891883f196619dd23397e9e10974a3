The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to issue a formal reprimand to Social Development Minister, Lindiwe Zulu, in light of the irresponsible video she posted on her social media, in which she stated that she had a hard time staying at home and that the “[Coronavirus] must go away”. While she has subsequently apologized, her comments simply cannot go unpunished. The Minister’s comments contradicted the measures and recommendations that her department announced for the collection of social grants. The Department has discouraged grant recipients from collecting their grants on the first day of payment and will ensure that no more than 100 people are served at a time at SASSA and Post Offices. The DA will monitor the grants collection process closely and will hold the Department to account if these measures are not strictly enforced. Minister Zulu’s comments are wholly irresponsible and sets a poor example to the public – especially the vulnerable communities who she represents. South Africa is gripped in a crisis due to the outbreak of Coronavirus in our country. As such, we require responsible leadership, especially from those in public office. We trust that the President will once again show the leadership he has shown during this unprecedented period, and hold the Minister fully responsible for her comments.
