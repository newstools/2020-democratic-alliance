The Democratic Alliance (DA) has lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) against the Department of Social Development (DSD) following a supposed instruction prohibiting NGOs from distributing cooked food to hungry people during this national lockdown period. We are of the view that the ban on the distribution of cooked food is in violation of the Constitution – particularly on the right to dignity, the right to life and the right to sufficient food, water and appropriate social assistance. Our complaint to the SAHRC is twofold: The ban on NGOs distributing cooked food will do more harm than good. Already in Gauteng, the DA has been reliably informed that the Cradle of Hope, an NGO based in Krugersdorp that has been supplying fresh sandwiches to around 600 needy residents for the past three years, has been forced to stop rendering this service after the Gauteng DSD issued a permit prohibiting them from distributing cooked food and only allows them to distribute non-perishable food parcels. Many of the residents who depended on these sandwiches are likely to face starvation because they either cannot afford water and electricity, or they do not have access to these amenities, in order to cook their own food. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that many families in Gauteng who have applied for food parcels in April are yet to receive any assistance from the Department This instruction to prohibit NGOs from distributing cooked food is problematic given the fact that Social Development Minister, Lindiwe Zulu’s leaked regulations are still in the draft phase and, therefore, not enforceable. Further to this, the ban seems more like an attempt to exercise power and punish the poor, than an attempt to protect the vulnerable from starvation. If the ANC-led Gauteng administration is serious about feeding the hungry and cares about the welfare of its people, then it must oppose the proposal by its national counterpart to ban the distribution of cooked meals.
