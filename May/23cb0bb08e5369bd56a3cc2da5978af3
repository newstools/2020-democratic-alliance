Please find attached letter from Natasha Mazzone MP, Chief Whip of the Official Opposition. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, to request that she urgently addresses the current chaos reigning in some of the virtual portfolio committee meetings. Should the Speaker fail to address the issue and not stop Parliament from becoming Constitutionally delinquent in its oversight role, the DA will request an opinion from the Constitutional Court to whom every Parliamentarian swear an oath. The manner in which some of the portfolio committee meetings have been run on virtual platforms during the Covid-19 lockdown is actively hampering Parliament’s Constitutional oversight role over the Executive. The DA has over this period, noticed the shameful manner in which some committee chairpersons seemingly use deliberate methods in virtual meetings to undermine Parliamentary oversight and give the Executive a free pass: The Executive cannot be given a free pass. The DA will do all in its power to curb Parliament’s descent to Constitutional delinquency. We will continue to fight to fulfill our mandate of Executive oversight to ensure that South Africans’ rights are not trampled upon and that the Rule of Law continues to reign supreme. Support our petition calling on the International Monetary Fund to direct the South African government to NOT use its relief aid financing in a way that discriminates: http://stopcoronaaiddiscrimination.co.za/
