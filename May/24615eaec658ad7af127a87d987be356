The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Shamila Batohi, to give urgent feedback on the status and progress of the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) special Covid-19 anti-corruption units. During his address to the nation on 23 March 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the NPA would establish these units to expedite the prosecution and sentencing of those who are involved in corrupt activities related to the Covid-19 crisis. To date, we have not had any update on the progress of these units whose work is particularly important in light of the brazen acts of corruption by those who are exploiting the Covid-19 crisis to further their selfish interests. President Ramaphosa emphatically stated that “[we] will act very strongly against any attempts at corruption and profiteering of this crisis”. Yet despite this tough talk, we are yet to hear any feedback from the NDPP on any progress made by the special Covid-19 anti-corruption units. The DA is particularly concerned on the lack of action related to food parcel corruption. There have been an unprecedented number of incidents where public office bearers have stolen food parcels, meant to assist the poor and vulnerable during the lockdown, and distribute it to friends, families and the politically connected. Aid that is aimed at assisting vulnerable people and businesses during this Covid-19 crisis, should be used only for its intended purpose, and those implicated in vile acts of corruption should not be allowed to continue as normal without any repercussions. The DA is therefore calling on the NDPP to give urgent clarity on: The President’s tough talk will prove to be nothing but hot air, if corrupt individuals who are alleged to have benefited from systemic and widespread corruption during this time are not arrested and tried for their actions.
