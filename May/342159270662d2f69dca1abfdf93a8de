The Departments of Social Development and Basic Education have sent mixed messages on the reopening of the Early Childhood Development (ECD) sector. The Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, on Friday, gazetted directions on the reopening of the ECD sector. The directions indicate that the sector would reopen on 6 July 2020. This stands in contrast to a circular sent out on the same day by the Acting Director-General of the Department of Social Development, Linton Mchunu, indicating that the sector shall remain closed and that consultations are currently ongoing. The DA calls for clarity from both Ministers Angie Motshekga and Lindiwe Zulu on what Government’s plans are regarding the reopening of the ECD sector. Parents across the country are anxious to know whether ECD centers will open, as more and more people are returning to work as a result of the risk-adjusted level 3 lockdown. In classic ANC fashion, it seems as though the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing. We need clarity on when ECD centers can reopen so that the necessary planning and Covid-19 protocols can be implemented. The DA has called for ECD centres to reopen under the risk-adjusted level 3 lockdown if these centres can fulfill and abide by a minimum list of Covid-19 health and safety protocols.
