The Democratic Alliance (DA) takes note of a report issued by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) into e-commerce and the huge advantages that it holds for trade and retail during the Covid-19 pandemic. This report should be the electric shock to Trade, Industry and Competition Minister, Ebrahim Patel to finally jolt him into action to gazette the unfettered trade of e-commerce in South Africa. The report makes some interesting findings and comments including: There can simply be no doubt that e-commerce is an incredible tool to support businesses in this growing economic disaster, as well as reinforce social distancing by allowing consumers to shop online and have goods delivered to their homes while avoiding shopping centres. To date, Minister Patel has found every irrational reason possible to not allow the total re-opening of e-commerce, all to the detriment of businesses, workers, consumers and revenue to the fiscus. It is becoming abundantly clear that Minister Patel and the Government are running out of road in their indefensible opposition to e-commerce and would be hard pressed to oppose a body like the WTO which we are full members of. The time for stalling is over and the time for action is now. Open e-commerce to its full extent and letâ€™s get goods and products moving across South Africa again.
