On Monday, the Department of Tourism presented its Tourism Recovery Plan to Parliament. The Democratic Alliance (DA) was left with more questions than answers as the recovery plan, which the Department claims would use a “risk-adjusted approach”, can only be described as one dimensional and devoid of any proper research. The only immediate proposal is its discriminatory race-based Tourism Relief Fund which will only do the sector more harm than good. Of particular concern to the DA were the following three points: With all these enormous gaps in the plan, it is clear that no proper scientific and statistical driven data has been defined and thus will not be collected and collated to inform a proper tourism recovery plan. This, therefore, explains the one-dimensional recovery plan which does not understand, nor take into account the reality of the tourism value chain. The Department did not present Parliament with a real tourism recovery plan – it was a hollow and unrealistic strategy and will not save the tourism industry. The DA will engage with the Department of Tourism to ensure that a proper and realistic tourism plan is put in place so that the closure of businesses and job losses are minimised.
