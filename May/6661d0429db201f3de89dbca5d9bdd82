The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Department of Sports, Arts and Culture (DSAC) to re-open the application period for artists and athletes to access support funding from the Arts and Sports Sector Relief Fund. We have also submitted Parliamentary questions to Minister Nathi Mthetwa in this regard. Our request follows a questionable application period, which came to an end on 6 April 2020. The DA has received several complaints from artists who have raised concerns with regards to the discrepancies of the application process and that they did not have enough time to complete their applications. Some of the complaints include: It is alarming that the Department would exclude any artist from accessing funding, especially as many of their livelihoods have been impacted with festivals, concerts and many other entertainment facilities having to shut their doors. All artists should have an equal opportunity to access funding with clear communication from the Department on the application process and criteria. In light of the challenges with the application process, the DA also calls on the Department to relook the application process to ensure that it is fair to every artist who applies. If our artists, engineers, recording studios and producers cannot access funding â€“ there might not be an industry left after we overcome the pandemic. The Arts and Culture sector will be one of the very last to get back on its feet and Government has to ensure that it does everything in its power to save it.
