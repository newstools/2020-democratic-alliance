The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the election of Leon van Wyk as the new Mayor of George. We congratulate Leon and wish him, and the DA team in George, well for their term in office. We are confident that the election of Mayor Van Wyk is the first important step towards restoring the integrity of the George Council, and will bring with it the “DA difference” that residents expect from us. Leon brings with him the integrity, energy and humility needed for the job. He will take the lead in focusing on attracting investment, growing the local economy, and retaining George’s status as one of the best places to live in South Africa. This way, the municipality will be properly resourced to improve basic service delivery to the poor and invest in much needed infrastructure. This is also an historic election – to our knowledge the first time a Mayor has been elected in a virtual Council meeting. We wish Leon and his team all the best for the future.
