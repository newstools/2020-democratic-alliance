The Democratic Alliance (DA) has learnt with great sadness of the passing of the chairperson of the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS), Dr Clarence Mini, due to Covid-19 complications. Dr Mini’s passing is a loss to the South African health industry. His role as chairperson of CMS was critical in the crafting of the country’s Universal Health Care path. During all my interactions with Dr Mini in Parliament he demonstrated compassion, kindness and a deep understanding of South Africa’s health system and it’s challenges. Covid-19 continues to show that it is affects all indiscriminately. It is, therefore, important that South Africans continue to practice impeccable personal hygiene; social distancing; regular mask-wearing and staying at home where it is possible. We send our sincere condolences to his colleagues at the CMS, his friends and his family. Akuhlanga lungehliyo sapho lakwa Mini.
