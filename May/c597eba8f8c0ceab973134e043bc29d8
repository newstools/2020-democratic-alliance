The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the announcement by Cabinet that Dr Sandile Buthelezi has been appointed as the new Director-General (DG) for the Department of Health. While we welcome the permanent appointment of critical posts such as this one, we need assurance from the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, that this will not in any way affect the Department’s response to Covid-19. Continuity and stability in the administrative leadership of any department is key to ensuring that there is sufficient accountability and clear deliverables. This is especially key during a time where South Africa is contending off a global health crisis. It is unclear whether this appointment will take effect immediately or if there will be a hand-over period by the current acting DG, Dr Anban Pillay. This is one of the issues that Minister Mkhize needs to clarify urgently. Covid-19 has necessitated the largest and most comprehensive public health response in South Africa’s history. It is therefore critical that there is a steady handover of leadership responsibilities and assurance from the Minister that we have a unified administrative leadership team that has unity of purpose. Daily we are reminded that lives and livelihoods are indeed at stake. The DA wishes to thank Dr Pillay for his contribution in the role as the acting DG and wishes Dr Buthelezi well in his new position.
