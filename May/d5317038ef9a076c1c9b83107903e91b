The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday evening received correspondence from SASSA CEO, Busisiwe Memela, regarding our request that SASSA offices countrywide be re-opened to assist with the influx of applications for social grants and relief during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Memela confirmed that the agency is currently in the process of preparing offices and implementing safety measures which will be finalised by 8 May 2020, including sanitation and provision of Personal Protective Equipment to employees. She went on to state that 30% of SASSA employees will return to work and occupy each of its offices. They will be responsible for processing electronic and telephonic applications. We are pleased that following pressure from the DA, SASSA has made some effort to capacitate its offices to assist with the increased pressure on its limited resources during this time, however, it is disappointing that these offices will remain closed to the public. The re-opening of SASSA offices to the public, under strict Covid-19 protocols, would have been an ideal solution to assist vulnerable South Africans in accessing much-needed social relief – especially those who do not have access to technological resources. The DA will closely monitor and assess the implementation and success of SASSA’s proposed measures and the limited re-opening of their offices. Should SASSA fail in this regard, the DA will not hesitate to go to court.
