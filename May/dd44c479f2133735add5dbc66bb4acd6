The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, to request an update on the removal proceedings against the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The DA’s proposal for the removal of the Public Protector was accepted by the Speaker on 26 February 2020 and we submitted our nominees to serve on the independent panel – which will determine whether there is a prima facie case for Parliament to continue with the removal process – well before the 6 March deadline. A clear timeline of the process needs to be outlined. It is for this reason that the DA has asked the Speaker for an update on the progress on the appointment process of the independent panel and when this will be finalized. We are of the view that the chosen panelists need to urgently start evaluating the merits of the case via virtual meetings. While the Covid-19 crisis inevitably postponed the process, Parliament has been open for two weeks now, and numerous committee meetings are in full swing on important issues other than the Covid-19 pandemic. The DA submits that the Coronavirus cannot be held up as an excuse and the removal proceedings against the Public Protector should, therefore, continue without any further delays. As the Covid-19 lockdown has continued, we have seen several reports and allegations of public office bearers abusing their positions at the expense of the South African public. As such, we will require an independent, competent Public Protector to investigate these abuses without fear or favour. And Busisiwe Mkhwebane is clearly not the right person for the job.
