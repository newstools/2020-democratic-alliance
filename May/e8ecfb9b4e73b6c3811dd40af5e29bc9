The Democratic Alliance has sent Trade, Industry and Competition Minister, Ebrahim Patel a book titled “E-Commerce, a South African Perspective” via an e-commerce platform to show him how easy and beneficial it is in the fight against Covid-19. We have also made a step-by-step video for the Minister on the purchase of this book in the hope it will dispel any lingering questions he may have about his continued ban on unfettered e-commerce trade. Just last week, the World Trade Organisation fully endorsed the use of e-commerce by saying that “the pandemic has made it clear that e-commerce can be an important tool/solution for consumers. E-commerce can also support small businesses and, by making economies more competitive, be an economic driver for both domestic growth and international trade”. There really can be no further objection from Minister Patel and the Government for the continued ban on e-commerce and to date, no real and justifiable reasons have been given by anyone on why South Africans can not buy whatever they want on the various platforms that exist in the country. In fact, the evidence locally and internationally only points to why e-commerce should be allowed. In the end, the real reason we find ourselves in this position over e-commerce comes down to ideology whereby Minister Patel is using this ban to achieve what he believes is “fair”. The truth is, this crisis has no winners and is not the time to determine what is and is not “fair”. The DA hopes the Minister will take our gift of this book and demonstration to heart and finally do what we all know is right, allow for the full and unfettered trade in e-commerce without further delay.
