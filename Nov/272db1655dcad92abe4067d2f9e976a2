The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls upon the South African government to submit a Red Notice request to Interpol, to pave the way for Malawian law enforcement authorities to extradite self-proclaimed prophet, Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, back to South Africa to answer for the crimes they are alleged to have committed. A Red Notice is an international wanted persons notice, which is published by Interpol at the request of a member country. The notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide, in this case Malawi, to locate and arrest a person pending extradition. While Interpol cannot compel law enforcement authorities to arrest any person who is the subject of a Red Notice, we trust that Malawi, as a member country, will comply with the Rules and Constitution of the international agency to detain and hand the two fugitives over. The Bushiris face serious charges of fraud, theft, and money laundering to the value of R102 million and should now be returned to South Africans to stand trial for these allegations. On top of that, they are now wanted fugitives who absconded and breached their bail conditions by illegally leaving South Africa. The DA firmly believes that this Red Notice, if submitted, will bring the Malawian law enforcement authorities on board to take action against the Bushiris and to support and speed up extradition proceedings.
