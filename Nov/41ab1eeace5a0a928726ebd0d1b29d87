We are delighted to announce the results of the Leadership Elections which took place at the Democratic Alliance (DA) elective Federal Congress 2020. Voting for Leadership Candidates took place using the online OpaVote platform and this system worked well. The election results were compliant with all DA election requirements and rules. They were signed off by us, as presiding officers, as well as the candidates’ party agents and also a professional audit firm who acted as independent external auditors and who oversaw the voting process. All individuals who observed voting consider the elections free and fair. This Congress was not only the largest, but also the most accessible and participatory Congress in the history of the DA. We thank all delegates for their participation, their compliance with the rules of our internal democracy, which remains healthy, strong and vibrant.
