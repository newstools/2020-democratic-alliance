The Democratic Alliance (DA) questions the appointment of Reshoketswe “Shokkie” Bopape as interim company secretary of Transnet SOC. Bopape was formerly company secretary of Alexkor SOC for a period of over two years. During her tenure at the State Diamond Mining company Alexkor’s administrator, Lloyd McPatie, said the company was trading recklessly and was unable to meet its financial obligations. He further recommended that the Johannesburg office of Alexkor be closed and retrenchments of staff be effected. A telephone call to the Johannesburg head office today rang fruitlessly and was unanswered –  indicative perhaps, of the closure of the office and the retrenchment of staff. The announcement of Bopape’s cadre deployment from one bankrupt and corrupt state- owned entity to Transnet – billed as having a vision to become Africa’s world champion in transport and logistics solutions – is of concern given her track record at Alexkor and the importance of her new role at the beleaguered behemoth. Clearly the more things change, the more they stay the same despite Minister Pravin Gordhan’s protestations to the contrary. The DA will be enquiring about Bopape’s tenure at Alexkor, the conditions of her retrenchment, details of the package, current salary and her suitability for her new role.
