The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today announced the names of candidates nominated to stand for election to Party Leadership roles at the DA elective Federal Congress on 31 October 2020 and 1 November 2020. In just 18 days, DA Federal Congress delegates will participate in a democratic internal election to select the leadership of the DA; successful candidates will subsequently take the Party forward. Preparation for DA Federal Congress 2020 is proceeding full steam ahead, and the hard work being carried out to prepare for a successful virtual Federal Congress is progressing to plan. Nominations for the candidates standing for election opened on 7 September 2020 and closed on Saturday 10 October 2020. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, the DA had to reimagine the format of our Federal Congress and chose to proceed virtually, with delegates attending congress from their homes and also from a variety of venues being made available nationwide. This approach ensures that the Congress is extremely accessible to all delegates, from all communities. In terms of the clause 6.1.4 of the DA Federal Constitution, “The Federal Congress elects the Leader, the Federal Chairperson and the [3] Deputy Federal Chairpersons.” Furthermore, alongside Federal Congress, the members of the DA Federal Council will vote for the Chairperson and two Deputy Chairpersons of Federal Council, as well as the Federal Finance Chairperson, in terms of clause 6.2.4.1 of the Federal Constitution. As the DA Federal Congress Presiding Officers, we have the pleasure of announcing the following candidates who have been nominated respectively: Federal Finance Chairperson (Uncontested): George, Dion Deputy Chairpersons of Federal Council (Uncontested) Masango, James Walters, Thomas Chairperson of Federal Council: Moriarty, Mike Zille, Helen Deputy Federal Chairpersons [3]: Bredell, Anton Lotriet, Annelie Nt’sekhe Refiloe Smalle, Jacques Federal Chairperson (Uncontested): Meyer, Ivan Federal Leader: Ntuli, Mbali Steenhuisen, John The DA looks forward to a robust and successful Federal Congress as we demonstrate a clear commitment to internal democracy in our Party, despite the limitations of the current pandemic.
