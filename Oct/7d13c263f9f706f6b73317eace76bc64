The Democratic Alliance (DA) has taken note of the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia De Lille’s challenge to “those who have evidence against (her)” to “bring it on”. We have taken up the Minister’s challenge and produce the following damning findings against her: These findings prove the Minister’s ongoing political meddling and bullying in her department. It shows that Minister De Lille is a constitutional delinquent, has operated outside of her mandate, and has conducted herself in a manner that is at odds with her oath of office. She must be fired.
