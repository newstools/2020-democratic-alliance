The Democratic Alliance (DA) can announce that planning and preparations for our virtual Federal Elective Congress on 31 October 2020 are proceeding full steam ahead. A Federal Congress of the DA is always a significant moment for the Party, electing leaders to take the Party forward for the next three years. This includes the election of the DA Federal Leader who will lead the Party and serve as leader of the opposition in South Africa. The pandemic and subsequent lockdown forced the DA to reimagine the format of our Federal Congress. Accordingly, the Party chose to progress virtually, with delegates attending congress from their homes and also from selected DA venues nationwide. This approach ensures that the Congress is equally accessible to all delegates, from all communities. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the DA is ensuring that the democratic process goes on, that our internal democracy works and that our approximate 2 000 delegates will be able to cast their votes. The DA today announces that Greg Krumbock MP and Desiree van der Walt MP have been appointed the Presiding Officers of Federal Congress 2020. Both are veteran electoral officers of the DA, having presided over dozens of Elective Congress events, and whose experience ensures a free and fair Elective Congresses. Furthermore, an independent auditor has been appointed to verify the elective process and ensure the integrity of the Federal Congress. The DA looks forward to a robust and successful Federal Congress as we remain committed to internal democracy and accountability. Further communications and announcements about DA Federal Congress 2020 will be communicated in the days ahead.
