The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the conflicting reports regarding a warrant of arrest for ANC Secretary General (SG) Ace Magashule. Whether Ace Magashuleâ€™s arrest is imminent or not, it would appear from evidence from various credible sources that his hands have been in the cookie jar, and it is high time he is held to account for the numerous allegations of misdeeds over the years. These include: As shocking as these allegations are, this is by no means an exhaustive list. During his time as Free State Premier, Magashule governed the province as though it was his own personal fiefdom. The DA has long called for Magashule to have his day in court and now is the time for the chickens to come home to roost. Magashule is far from the only comrade in the ANC to have engaged in dodgy dealings. There are many others, like Deputy President David Mabusa, Nomvula Mokonyane, and ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe who need to face the music as well. The ANC has been a safe haven for crooks and criminals for too long, and there seems to be no end to this in sight under President Cyril Ramaphosa.
