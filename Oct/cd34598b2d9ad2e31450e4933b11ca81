The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the decision by the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa to give a notice of government intervention to the International Cricket Council (ICC) in the  affairs of Cricket South Africa (CSA). This intervention by government is far from ideal, as it could open the door to political interference at CSA. We trust that no decisions will be made without the applicable response from the ICC. The DA maintains that the appointment of an independent committee to investigate the ongoing challenges within CSA would be a much better option. Urgent intervention is required to address the financial, administrative and management challenges that the CSA board has failed to turn around. The CSA board must carry the blame for this government intervention – cricket in South Africa is in this situation because the board chose to ignore several calls to submit itself to administrative intervention. Instead of playing open cards, the board also chose to table a whitewashed forensic report into its affairs which effectively attempts to scapegoat one person for the crisis within CSA. All board members and executives, past and present, who were involved in CSA’s maladministration should be investigated, as the blame cannot be laid solely at the feet of one man. The CSA board must fall on its sword for its failure to address challenges in South African cricket despite numerous chances to do so and submit itself to a full, transparent and independent investigation.
