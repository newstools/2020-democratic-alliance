The Democratic Alliance (DA) has seen an internal Department of Social Development document which shows that Hangwani Muluadzi, Hawks spokesperson, changed the name of his NPO from the Hangwani Mulaudzi Foundation to the Bono Foundation in August 2020. The DA wants to know why Mulaudzi changed the name of his organisation? When he proudly proclaimed to The Star newspaper, on 16 October 2020, that the foundation was named after him “… because my name is popular, simple (sic)”. Or was this sudden change in name as a result of his interview with the Limpopo Mirror in July 2020? The DA finds this all rather strange considering the sequence and timing of events. Moreover, the internal document revealed that Muluadzi’s foundation failed to submit annual reports and compliance documents since 2018. How is it possible that the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) funded this organisation to the tune of R3 million when they did not have the requisite documents to support such a disbursement? It is clear that that due diligence was not performed by the NLC and its grant funding division. This is not the first time this has happened and will continue to happen until Minister Ebrahim Patel finds the courage and decides to fire the NLC’s board. The DA reiterates its call on the Head of the Hawks, Dr. Godfrey Lebeya, to place Mulaudzi under suspension until a full investigation into his conduct relating to this matter is completed.
