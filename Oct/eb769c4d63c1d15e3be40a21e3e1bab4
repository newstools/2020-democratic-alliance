The DA has launched a detailed and information-rich website ahead of the virtual Federal Congress which takes place on Saturday 31 October and Sunday 1 November. For the first time, the 2020 Federal Congress order of events and sessions is now published, and is available on the Congress website. The website is a one-stop-shop for Congress delegates and also for members of the public to discover more about the historic DA Congress taking place later this month. The arrangements for our innovative Congress continue smoothly. With more than 2000 delegates attending from their homes or from physical venues nationwide, as connected to the virtual Congress, this is South Africa’s largest ever virtual political congress. The website includes a 14-page delegates’ guide which is a handbook for delegates attending the elective meeting. The site also contains the DA’s first ever digital toolkit for a Federal Congress. The kit includes the DA’s values ​​and principles adopted at our Policy Conference earlier this year and a variety of digital graphic and social media content. The site also explains the Congress theme: Real Hope. Real Change. Now. The Congress website will soon add a full media information section, with the full scope of details required for journalists and media houses to ensure successful coverage of the virtual Congress. This website will be updated regularly as information is released by the Party in the run-up to the Congress. We are delighted to be able to ensure that despite more than 200 days of Covid-lockdown, the DA’s democratic processes go on and our internal democracy is working.
