The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the latest ‘notice to affected persons’ by SAA’s Business Rescue Practitioners stating that the provision of timeous short term funding from government has not materialised and that the creditors will be asked to consider the future of the airline. Tomorrow’s meeting with SAA affected persons, called by SAA’s Business Rescue Practitioners, should have one item on the agenda: the groundwork to begin the liquidation of SAA. It has become clear by now that no one is coming to rescue the bankrupt SAA. Quite clearly the promises made to SAA creditors on 14 July 2020 by the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, and the Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni, that the additional funding of R10.4 billion over and above the R16.2 billion taxpayer bailout already budgeted for was wishful thinking and they have not been able to find any suckers willing to provide the R10.4 billion funding required to attempt the resuscitation of the “dead duck” SAA. Ministers Gordhan and Mboweni would seem to have only one option left to them and that is to include a further taxpayer bailout in the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) in October 2020. Our information is that: If President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is serious about structural economic reform, the liquidation and closure of bankrupt entities such as SAA is a good place to start.
