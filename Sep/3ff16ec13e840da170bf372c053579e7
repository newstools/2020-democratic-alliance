The Democratic Alliance (DA) wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask why he has not taken any decisive action against the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille, given the long list of allegations that have been levelled against her. (See here) This past week, further allegations emerged of Minister De Lille’s apparent incessant meddling in the procurement processes of her department. Reports indicate that the Minister allegedly approved farming leases as part of the government’s programme to lease State-owned land to deserving emerging farmers, without following due diligence. She has also been accused by staff in the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) of using her Special Advisor, Nadine Fourie, to pay a construction contractor R40 million to refurbish a Department of Environmental Affairs’ research facility, Sanae IV in Antarctica, despite the fact that this company had overcharged the Department by R39 million before. In addition to the abovementioned allegations, the Minister has also been accused of the following: The DA sent these allegations to the President and urge him to fire the Minister for her alleged malfeasance. President Ramaphosa can’t continue to talk tough on corruption and then turn a blind eye to wrongdoing right under his nose. These allegations and findings have shown time and again that Minister De Lille seems to have no with problem being a constitutional delinquent and breaking the oath of her office. She seems to enjoy playing dictator in the DPWI and then tries to dodge allegations by blaming subordinates. The President cannot afford to wait while the list grows before he takes action against her. Her actions have proven her unworthy of her office. It’s long past time for her to go.
