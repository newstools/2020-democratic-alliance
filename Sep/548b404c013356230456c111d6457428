The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision by the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) to refer 11 senior officials to the Office of the State Attorney to be charged for their alleged involvement in irregularities related to the Beitbridge Border fence debacle. While this is a positive step in ensuring accountability for what was effectively a washing line, the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille – the most senior person involved in the saga – should also carry the can for issuing an unlawful emergency directive on the fence. A Special Investigative Unit (SIU) report found that the Minister’s instructions “placed an enormous project and compliance risk on the Department”. The DA therefore questions when Minister De Lille will be held responsible as she is the initiator of the project. Every single official that was involved in the process of erecting the R1 million per kilometer fence, rightly or wrongly, acted in accordance to the instruction which came down from De Lille’s office. It is, therefore, inconceivable for officials to be charged alone, while De Lille and her advisor Melissa Whitehead get away scot-free. Corruption and gross misconduct have become endemic and continues unabated under President Cyril Ramaphosa’s watch. And instead of holding his Cabinet Ministers to account, they are shielded from blame and allowed to scapegoat their officials. Not only must De Lille be charged, she should also be fired.
