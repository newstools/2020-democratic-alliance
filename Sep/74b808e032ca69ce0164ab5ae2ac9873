The Democratic Alliance (DA) is shocked by yet another horrific Gender-Based Violence related murder and we call on national government to address this issue with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Nosicelo Tsipaâ€™s body was found yesterday after she was brutally murdered on Sunday, 6 September, by her husband who buried her afterwards in an open field in Greenville, Fisantekraal. The accused will appear in the Western Cape High court tomorrow, 11 September 2020. Nosicelo, and thousands of other women before her, is a victim not only of the devastating scourge of GBV but of a government that is unwilling to put action into words. The time has come for the ANC government to stop paying lip service to this pandemic and to start dealing decisively with the issue. The DA demands that government immediately develop comprehensive legislation on the matter; capacitate police stations to assist victims with efficiency; to allocate more national resources to this battle, and to expedite the implementation of the strategic national GBV plan. Furthermore, we call for harsher judicial penalties for offenders. The DA, together with all 30 million women of South Africa, say enough is enough. We need government to act, and we need government to act now! The women of South Africa deserve better.
