The Democratic Alliance (DA) is pleased to confirm that excellent progress is being made in our inaugural virtual Policy Conference. Our Federal Council remains engaged in active democratic debate aimed at agreeing and reaffirming our values, principles and policies. Only the DA offers South Africans of all backgrounds and groups truly evidence-based policy-making and only the DA develops robust solutions to the significant issues facing our country. Currently, our Council is considering the DAâ€™s Economic Justice Policy and further announcements will be made about this progressive policy shortly. Whilst the ANC offer policy aimed at enriching a small group of insiders, the DA creates policy to benefit all South Africans. Due to the current Covid-19 restrictions, the DA has utilised Zoom and Zoom voting functions for this conference. Such functions are easy to use and highly accessible. The DA augments any voting process with quality assurance and audit processes, including during this conference. The various steps taken by the DA fully ensure that our internal votes represent the views or Federal Council. This virtual conference proves that modern-day technology, backed up by due process and stringent governance, provide a robust platform for voting.
