The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the arrests of 10 people including an EFF MP for the destruction of property in light of the violent Clicks protests throughout the country. These arrests come after the DA laid criminal charges on Monday against Julius Malema and the EFF for incitement to violence, malicious damage to property and intimidation and provided South African Police Services (SAPS) with evidence of these offences. While we are encouraged by these arrests and welcome Minister Cele’s statement condemning acts of criminality, we call on the SAPS to ensure that all EFF members who have committed a crime, including Julius Malema, are also arrested. The DA, like many other South Africans, were outraged by the deeply hurtful and careless Clicks advert which has caused a great deal of pain to many South Africans. There is no place for this brazen racial stereotyping in our society. Although the DA supports every South African’s right to protest, we cannot condone the blatant violence and destruction on the part of the EFF and their acolytes. The state must never surrender its responsibility and its authority to vigilantes who take the law into their own hands The DA is of the view that in addition to these arrests, the EFF must be held liable for the damage and destruction to Clicks stores. The party has through their actions demonstrated a complete disregard for the rule of law as well as the protection of private property. This destruction of property will potentially have serious consequences for thousands of Clicks employees whose livelihoods could be severely strained if these shops were to be closed permanently. No one is above the law, and the DA will continue to put pressure on the SAPS to take action against the EFF.
