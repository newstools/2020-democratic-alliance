Tomorrow, 2 September 2020, at 09:00 the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) is due to appear before Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Trade, Industry and Competition. This comes after the Democratic Alliance (DA) placed the Committee Chairperson, Duma Nkosi, and the NLC under immense pressure to come and account for the fact they failed to release their lists of Covid-19 Relief Fund and 2018/2019 grant beneficiaries. It was only after the DA obtained a legal opinion on the release of these lists and laid criminal charges against the entire NLC’s board that this information was made public. Each and every step of the way, ANC members of the Portfolio Committee have tried to stifle the work of Parliament by defending the NLC indiscriminately. Tomorrow is the day of reckoning for the NLC and they must prepare themselves to be grilled. The proceedings can be followed on Parliament’s YouTube channel.
