The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes an announcement by KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Premier, Sihle Zikalala, that the provincial government will convene a multi-stakeholder meeting in order to address the issue of farm and rural safety. The move by the Premier comes after the DA in KZN recently submitted a 10-point action plan to the Premier. This following the senseless and brutal killing of a Normandien couple this past weekend, as well as the spate of killings in Mthwalume. The DA’s suggestions to the Premier included convening a special and urgent summit of stakeholders and experts to advise government on practical steps that can be taken to curb the scourge of farm attacks and murders and address growing concerns around rural safety. The DA regards the Premier’s move as a step forward in making our farming and rural communities safer for all, black or white, farmer or farm worker. We now urge the Premier to implement more of the proposals which include; The DA in KZN will continue to be the loudest political voice championing the issue of rural and farm safety in our province. We will also continue to put workable solutions to our collective challenges on the table.
