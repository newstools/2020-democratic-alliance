The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, to expedite our request for Parliament to establish a Covid-19 accountability committee in light of the findings by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AG) on the extent of Covid-19 corruption on the part of government. The DA repeatedly called for government and Parliament to establish various mechanisms to prevent the inevitable corruption that would ensue during this pandemic. Not only did we ask for an accountability committee in Parliament, but the DA also requested that Treasury establish a Special Inspector General for Covid Expenditure in May. It is not for nought that the AG concluded that the Covid-19 relief package from government landed in an environment that created ample opportunities for the looting of resources. Looters of state coffers have after all become quite adept at extorting any given opportunity for their own gain to the detriment of society’s most vulnerable. The following key findings from the AG’s report warrants further investigation and intervention: There clearly is a need for Parliament to investigate the findings released by the AG on Wednesday to ensure that those members of the Executive who were responsible for overseeing this corruption and maladministration are held fully responsible for their failures. South Africa has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent extended lockdown. Not only have our citizens been fighting for their lives against the Coronavirus, but they’ve been fighting for survival against those who would rather see millions in their graves, than see money go to the causes they are meant to serve. The Speaker must therefore do the right thing and urgently allow for an ad hoc committee in Parliament on Covid-19.
